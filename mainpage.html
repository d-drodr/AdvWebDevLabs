                            Ever since I was a child, I loved solving puzzles. I also liked playing with computers and was always fascinated by how they work. I went and chose to study Computer Science since then.
                            <br>Aside from that, I love to challenge myself as much as I can and learn anything I can, which is why I chose to learn French, and have taken over 5 years so far. My next goal is to learn another language, making it 4 that I know.
